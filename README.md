# gif-enc
A rather inefficient GIF encoder, in ~64 lines of python.

The goal of this project was to understand how the GIF format works, along with quantisation and dithering techniques.

Colour quantisation is achieved using `MiniBatchKMeans` from scikit. Dithering is implemented using the Floydâ€“Steinberg algorithm.

GIF image data is stored using LZW compression. My implementation doesn't actually do any compression, although it still has to use the LZW format.

## Example:

```python
import ppm
import gif

rgb_pixels = ppm.loadppm(open("tests/cat256.ppm", "rb"))
indices, palette = gif.palettise(rgb_pixels)

gif.save(open("tests/cat.gif", "wb"), indices, palette)
```

Input (converted from PPM to PNG so your browser can view it):

Output:

## Steganography

Using the relatively simple method of merging two images together as a "6 dimensional" image, treating
it as if it were a single image with 6 colour channels, I was able to reuse the same clustering algorithm
to create an image which contains two seperate images in one. Only one image is visible at a time, and
reversing the order of the entries in the colour pallete reveals the second image.

```python
import ppm
import gif

rgb_pixels_a = ppm.loadppm(open("tests/cat256.ppm", "rb"))
rgb_pixels_b = ppm.loadppm(open("tests/parrot256.ppm", "rb"))

# merge the two 3-channel images into a single 6-channel image
rgbrgb_pixels = [[a+b for a, b in zip(a_row, b_row)] for a_row, b_row in zip(rgb_pixels_a ,rgb_pixels_b)]

indices, palette = gif.palettise(rgbrgb_pixels, n_entries=128)

# un-merge the 6-channel pallete into a 3-channel palette
palette_a = [rgbrgb[:3] for rgbrgb in palette]
palette_a += list(reversed([rgbrgb[3:] for rgbrgb in palette]))

gif.save(open("tests/a.gif", "wb"), indices, palette_a)
gif.save(open("tests/b.gif", "wb"), indices, list(reversed(palette_a))) # exactly the same image data, only reversed palette order
```

This image could be considered the "cover" image:

To reveal the second image, the recipient just needs to reverse the order of the pallete entries:

If you examine these two files in a hex editor, you can verify that the only difference is in the colour
pallete, a 768 byte region located at a 13 byte offset in the file. The rest of the two files are completely
identical.
