# gif-enc
A rather inefficient GIF encoder, in ~64 lines of python.

The goal of this project was to understand how the GIF format works, along with quantisation and dithering techniques.

Colour quantisation is achieved using `MiniBatchKMeans` from scikit. Dithering is implemented using the Floydâ€“Steinberg algorithm.

GIF image data is stored using LZW compression. My implementation doesn't actually do any compression, although it still has to use the LZW format.

## Example:

```python
import ppm
import gif

rgb_pixels = ppm.loadppm(open("tests/cat256.ppm", "rb"))
indices, palette = gif.palettise(rgb_pixels)

gif.save(open("tests/cat.gif", "wb"), indices, palette)
```

Input (converted from PPM to PNG so your browser can view it):

Output:

I plan to use this code to play with some GIF steganography techniques I've come up with.
